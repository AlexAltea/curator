1
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,660
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,700
America has made my fortune.

3
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,920
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,840
I gave her freedom, but I taught
her never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,420
She found a boyfriend,
not an Italian.

6
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,930
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,720
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,520
Two months ago he took her for a
drive with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,190
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,650
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,870
She resisted, she
kept her honor.

12
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,000
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,550
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,180
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,730
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,730
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,400
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,030
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

20
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,960
Sorry.

21
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,930
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,680
These two boys were
brought to trial.

23
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,560
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,770
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Suspended the sentence! They
went free that very day!

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,530
I stood in the
courtroom like a fool.

27
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,120
Those two bastards,
they smiled at me.

28
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,960
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,760
Why did you go to the police? Why
didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:50,980
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,730
What is that?

32
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,700
I want them dead.

33
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,130
That I cannot do.

34
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,970
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,890
I've known you many years, but this is
the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,110
I can't remember the last time you
invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,030
Even though my wife is
godmother to your only child.

38
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,120
But let's be Frank here. You
never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,950
And you were afraid
to be in my debt.

40
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,450
I didn't want to
get into trouble.

41
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,210
I understand.

42
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,590
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,550
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,350
You didn't need a
friend like me.

45
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,560
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,060
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,820
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,610
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:36,210
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,830
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,420
Let them suffer, then,
as she suffers.

53
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,850
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,450
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,620
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,290
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,790
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,090
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,850
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,480
Be my friend?

61
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,980
Godfather?

62
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,530
Good.

63
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,830
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,330
But until that day

65
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,420
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,920
- Gràzie, Godfather.
- Prego.

67
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,680
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,440
I want people that aren't
going to get carried away.

69
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,690
We're not murderers, in spite
of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,390
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,600
We're not taking the
picture without Michael.

72
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,400
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,750
Don Barzini.

74
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,430
Hey, Paulie! Let
me have some wine.

75
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,770
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,820
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,150
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,160
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,710
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,110
20, 30 grand. In
small bills, cash.

81
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,440
In that little silk purse.

82
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,110
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

83
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,450
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,330
I got two gabagool,
capocol, and a prosciut.

85
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,500
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,550
What's the matter?

87
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,400
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,730
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,580
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,630
Get out of here! It's a
private party. Go on!

91
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,670
What is it? It's my
sister's wedding.

92
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,970
Goddamn FBI don't
respect nothing!

93
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,360
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,170
But towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,340
so for six months he's
worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,170
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,220
Now that the war is over,

98
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,300
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,270
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,980
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,440
You understand everything.

102
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,650
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,750
Wait till you see the wedding
cake I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,580
The bride, the groom
and the angel...

105
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,380
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,035
Give it to a Jew Congressman
in another district.

107
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:48,600
Who else is on the list?

108
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,230
Hey, Michael!

109
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,500
He's not on the list, but
Luca Brasi wants to see you.

110
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,720
Is this necessary?

111
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,430
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

112
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,190
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

113
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,110
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

114
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,610
May their first child
be a masculine child.

115
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,240
Michael...

116
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,410
That man over there is
talking to himself.

117
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,330
See that scary guy over there?

118
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,920
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

119
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,670
His name is Luca Brasi. He
helps my father out sometimes.

120
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,390
Michael, he's coming over here!

121
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,560
You look terrific!

122
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,940
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

123
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,940
Your father's been
asking for you.

124
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,860
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

125
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,320
Why does your brother
have a different name?

126
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,290
My brother Sonny found
Tom Hagen in the street.

127
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,290
He had no home, so my
father took him in.

128
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,130
He's been with us ever since.

129
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,170
He's a good lawyer.

130
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,590
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

131
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,600
- What's that?
- That's a,

132
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,470
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

133
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,640
You like your lasagna?

134
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,110
Don Corleone.

135
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,860
I'm honored and grateful

136
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,780
that you have invited me to
your daughter's wedding.

137
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,080
On the day of your
daughter's wedding.

138
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,000
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

139
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,550
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

140
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,940
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

141
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,150
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

142
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,030
Thank you.

143
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,870
Signora Corleone!

144
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,910
No!

145
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,110
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

146
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,450
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

147
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,710
What is that outside?

148
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,340
Johnny! Johnny!

149
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,060
I love you!

150
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,780
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

151
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,360
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

152
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,700
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

153
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,140
You never said you
knew Johnny Fontane!

154
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,310
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

155
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,230
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

156
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,400
How?

157
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,780
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

158
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,270
Please, Michael. Tell me.

159
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,820
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

160
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,780
with a big bandleader.

161
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,120
And as his career got better and
better, he wanted to get out of it.

162
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,870
Johnny is my father's godson.

163
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,290
My father went to see
this bandleader.

164
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,260
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,

165
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,090
but the bandleader said no.

166
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,560
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

167
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,560
Within an hour,

168
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,150
he signed a release for a
certified check of $ 1,000.

169
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,110
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

170
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,660
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

171
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:57,000
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

172
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,630
That's a true story.

173
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,730
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

174
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,990
Beautiful!

175
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,360
I'll take care of it.

176
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,320
Tom...

177
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,120
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

178
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,340
How are you, Fredo?

179
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,010
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

180
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,380
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

181
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,850
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

182
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,520
Yeah. This is your friend?

183
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,270
I don't know what to do. My
voice is weak. It's weak.

184
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,450
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

185
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,870
But this... man won't give it
to me, the head of the studio.

186
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,210
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

187
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,460
He won't give it to me, and
he says there's no chance.

188
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,010
Sonny?

189
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,800
Sonny?

190
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,480
Sonny?

191
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,060
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

192
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,020
The old man wants you.

193
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,980
One minute.

194
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,460
A month ago he bought the movie
rights to this book, a best-seller.

195
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,130
The main character is
a guy just like me.

196
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,890
I wouldn't even have to act.

197
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,680
Godfather, I don't
know what to do.

198
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,270
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

199
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:09,070
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

200
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,200
"What can I do? What can I
do?" What is that nonsense?

201
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,990
Ridiculous.

202
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,830
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

203
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,579
Good.

204
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,300
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

205
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,390
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

206
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,770
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

207
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,980
It's too late, they start
shooting in a week.

208
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,230
I'm going to make him an
offer he can't refuse.

209
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,070
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

210
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,290
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

211
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,650
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

212
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,360
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

213
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,790
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

214
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,660
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

215
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,210
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

216
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,710
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

217
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,140
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

218
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,600
If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

219
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,730
Carlo, we're going
to take the picture.

220
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,570
Wait a minute.

221
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,940
No, Michael. Not me.

222
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,330
Okay, that's it. Just like that.
Hold it!

223
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,650
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

224
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,150
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

225
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,990
This friend would give his
friendship to Mr. Woltz,

226
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,910
if Mr. Woltz would
grant us a favor.

227
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,330
Woltz is listening.

228
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,500
Give Johnny the part in that war
film you're starting next week.

229
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,220
And what favor would your
friend grant Mr. Woltz?

230
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,850
He could make your future
union problems disappear.

231
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,020
And one of your stars has just
moved from marijuana to heroin.

232
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,400
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

233
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,070
Let me lay it on the line.

234
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,150
Johnny Fontane will
never get that movie!

235
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,780
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

236
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,700
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

237
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,160
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

238
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,630
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

239
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,250
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

240
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,340
I'll wait for your call.

241
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,050
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

242
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,350
Check him out.

243
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,420
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

244
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,010
- It used to decorate a King's palace.
- Very nice.

245
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,470
Why didn't you say you
work for Corleone?

246
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,800
I thought you were some cheap
hustler Johnny was running in.

247
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,220
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

248
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,810
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

249
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,480
You do appreciate
beauty, don't you?

250
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,490
There you are. $600,000
on four hoofs.

251
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,530
I bet Russian czars never
paid that for a single horse.

252
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,160
Khartoum.

253
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,080
Khartoum.

254
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

255
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,130
Thanks, Tony.

256
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Let's get something to eat.

257
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,340
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

258
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,850
To the Italian people that's a
very sacred, close relationship.

259
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,850
I respect it. Tell him
to ask me anything else.

260
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,270
This favor I can't give him.

261
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,650
He never asks a second favor when
he's been refused the first.

262
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,910
You don't understand. Johnny
Fontane never gets that movie.

263
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,660
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

264
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,870
I'm going to run him out of the
business, and let me tell you why.

265
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,550
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

266
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,010
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

267
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,720
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

268
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,600
Let me be even more Frank.

269
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,185
To show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man.

270
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:43,690
That it's not all
dollars and cents.

271
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,400
She was beautiful. She
was young and innocent!

272
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,910
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

273
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:59,120
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

274
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,910
And she runs off.

275
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,340
She threw it all away just
to make me look ridiculous!

276
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,590
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

277
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,010
You get the hell out of here!

278
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,470
If that goombah tries any rough
stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader.

279
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,770
Yeah, I heard that story.

280
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,610
Thank you for dinner and
a very pleasant evening.

281
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,570
Maybe your car can take
me to the airport.

282
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,240
Mr. Corleone insists on
hearing bad news immediately.

283
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,860
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

284
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,030
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

285
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,360
Now...

286
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,910
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

287
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,950
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife,

288
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,460
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

289
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,790
His business is narcotics.

290
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,250
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

291
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,170
In Sicily he has plants to
process them into heroin.

292
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,760
He needs cash, he needs
protection from the police.

293
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,770
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

294
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:11,100
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

295
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,980
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

296
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,820
He's known as a top
narcotics man.

297
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,580
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

298
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,290
Tom?

299
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,540
Yes. There's more money in
narcotics than anything else.

300
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,380
If we don't get into it, somebody
else will, maybe the five families.

301
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,930
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

302
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,100
Then they come after us.

303
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,730
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

304
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:55,940
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

305
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,570
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

306
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,080
Don Corleone.

307
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,460
I need a man who has
powerful friends.

308
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,300
I need a million
dollars in cash.

309
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,220
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

310
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,680
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

311
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,730
In the first year your end should
be three, four million dollars.

312
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,810
And then it would go up.

313
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,440
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

314
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,280
My compliments.

315
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,370
I'll take care of them,
out of my share.

316
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,750
So I receive 30% for finance,

317
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,170
political influence
and legal protection?

318
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,960
That's right.

319
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,180
Why do you come to me? Why do
I deserve this generosity?

320
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,560
If you consider a million
dollars in cash just finance,

321
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,810
te salud Don Corleone.

322
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,580
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

323
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,910
to be treated with respect.

324
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,880
But, I must say no to you.

325
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,880
And I'll give you my reason.

326
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,800
It's true, I have a lot
of friends in politics.

327
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,470
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

328
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,190
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

329
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,280
It doesn't make any difference to
me what a man does for a living.

330
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,610
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

331
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,120
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

332
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,710
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

333
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,800
I have a sentimental weakness for
my children, and I spoil them.

334
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,140
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

335
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,640
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish
to congratulate you on your new business.

336
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,190
I know you'll do
well, and good luck.

337
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:46,110
Especially since your interests don't
conflict with mine. Thank you.

338
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,670
Santino.

339
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,590
Come here.

340
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,850
What's the matter with you?

341
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,560
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

342
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,770
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

343
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,320
Go on.

344
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,120
Tom, what's this nonsense?

345
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,620
It's from Johnny. He's
starring in that new film.

346
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,540
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

347
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,380
And

348
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,590
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

349
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,140
I'm a little worried about
this Sollozzo fellow.

350
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,180
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

351
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,810
Go to the Tattaglias.

352
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,190
Make them think that you're
not too happy with our family

353
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,950
and find out what you can.

354
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,720
I got something for your
mother and for Sonny

355
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,470
and a tie for Freddy, and Tom
Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

356
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,810
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

357
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,630
Andiamo, Fredo.

358
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,140
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

359
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,230
I'll have to get it myself. Paulie
called in sick this morning.

360
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,230
Paulie's a good kid. I don't
mind getting the car.

361
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,820
Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.

362
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,740
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

363
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,670
You know who I am?

364
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,090
I know you.

365
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,970
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

366
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,970
I think you and I
can do business.

367
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,480
I need someone strong like you.

368
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,940
I heard you are not happy...

369
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,650
with the Corleone family.

370
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,150
Want to join me?

371
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,280
What's in it for me?

372
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,830
$50,000 to start with.

373
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,080
Not bad!

374
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,380
Agreed?

375
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,520
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

376
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:19,570
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

377
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,700
Make time, Consigliere.
Get in the car.

378
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:29,040
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

379
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,580
Get in.

380
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,300
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

381
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,940
Merry Christmas. I
want some fruit.

382
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,530
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Like in the story.

383
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,660
No.

384
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,120
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

385
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,670
Michael.

386
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,170
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

387
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,050
What's the matter?

388
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,610
They don't say if
he's dead or alive.

389
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,170
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

390
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,010
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

391
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:36,140
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

392
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,350
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

393
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,360
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

394
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,490
No. Look, come home, kid. You
should be with Mama, you hear?

395
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,540
Oh, my God.

396
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,960
Sonny!

397
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,140
Stay back there.

398
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,890
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

399
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,560
There's more news
about your old man.

400
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,820
Word is out that
he's already dead.

401
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:31,150
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

402
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,570
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

403
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,080
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

404
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,950
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

405
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,880
I don't care how sick he is. Bring
him to my father's house right now.

406
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,050
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

407
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,230
I'm going to have a couple of our
people come over to the house.

408
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,310
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

409
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,230
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

410
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,030
In three hours he'll be
released with our proposition.

411
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,450
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

412
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,160
What's done is done. Don't lose
that famous temper of yours, Sonny.

413
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,960
I'll wait.

414
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,310
Your boss is dead.

415
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,560
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

416
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:52,530
I want you to help the
Corleones and me.

417
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:00,990
We got him outside his office about
an hour after we picked you up.

418
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,700
Drink it.

419
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,920
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

420
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,930
Sonny was hot for
my deal, wasn't he?

421
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,140
And you knew it was the
right thing to do.

422
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:29,440
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

423
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:37,360
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

424
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:42,530
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

425
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:47,830
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don rest in peace was slipping.

426
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,840
Ten years ago, could I
have gotten to him?

427
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,680
Well, now he's dead, Tom, and
nothing can bring him back.

428
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:09,350
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

429
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,400
It's good business, Tom.

430
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,620
I'll try. But even Sonny won't
be able to call off Luca Brasi.

431
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,450
Yeah, well...

432
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,670
Let me worry about Luca.

433
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,260
You just talk to Sonny.

434
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,590
And the other two kids.

435
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,060
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

436
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,850
Now you can go.

437
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,370
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

438
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,910
Blood is a big expense.

439
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,020
He's still alive.

440
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,060
They hit him with five
shots, and he's still alive!

441
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,900
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

442
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,030
Your mother is at the
hospital with your father.

443
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:27,450
Looks like he'll pull through.

444
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,920
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

445
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,420
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

446
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,960
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

447
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:46,340
What about Luca? Sollozzo
thinks he can control him.

448
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,220
If Luca sold out, we're
in a lot of trouble.

449
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,890
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

450
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,020
- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

451
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:05,320
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

452
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:12,660
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

453
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:18,420
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

454
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,050
This is almost 1946. Nobody
wants bloodshed anymore.

455
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,800
If your father dies

456
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,970
you make the deal.

457
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:33,930
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

458
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,020
What is it?

459
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:46,820
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

460
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,030
Tessio, go see what it is.

461
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,620
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

462
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,460
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

463
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,130
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

464
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,840
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

465
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:12,640
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

466
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,310
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

467
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:20,690
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

468
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,480
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

469
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,740
Hanging around the house on the
phone would be a big help.

470
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,530
Try Luca again.

471
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,210
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

472
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,170
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

473
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,980
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

474
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,730
Probably late.

475
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,950
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,700
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

477
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,670
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

478
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:29,630
We have to find a spot on the West Side.
Try 309 West 43rd Street.

479
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,220
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

480
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,060
Think while you're driving. I
want to hit New York this month.

481
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,890
Watch the kids.

482
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:55,570
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

483
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,080
Yeah, all right.

484
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,580
Make sure they're clean, because the
guys will be there a long time.

485
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,920
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

486
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,960
Exterminate! Watch out, so
we don't exterminate you!

487
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,180
Pull over. I've got
to take a leak.

488
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,270
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

489
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,330
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

490
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,380
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

491
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,630
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

492
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,350
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

493
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:46,430
He's going to make it.

494
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,730
I love you.

495
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,770
I love you!

496
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,240
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

497
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,240
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

498
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,200
Can't you say it?

499
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,280
I'll see you tonight.

500
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,210
Why don't you tell that
nice girl you love her?

501
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:12,090
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

502
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:18,050
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

503
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,760
You start with a little
oil, then fry some garlic.

504
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:27,520
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

505
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,690
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

506
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,650
Add a little bit of wine.

507
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,320
And a little bit of sugar.
That's my trick.

508
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:47,700
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

509
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,000
You won't see him no more.

510
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,960
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

511
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,550
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

512
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,970
He'll be all right. Sollozzo
knows he's a civilian.

513
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,050
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

514
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,470
Send somebody with him anyway.

515
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,590
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

516
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,720
No, Kay. There will be detectives
there, people from the press.

517
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,930
I'll wait in the cab.

518
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,190
I don't want you
to get involved.

519
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,150
When will I see you again?

520
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:08,620
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

521
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:15,080
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

522
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:31,140
What are you doing here? You're
not supposed to be here.

523
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,720
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

524
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,140
What happened to the guards?

525
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:42,650
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

526
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,070
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

527
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:54,530
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

528
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,410
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

529
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:08,300
Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got
here late, there's nobody here.

530
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:12,680
No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody.
Papa's all alone.

531
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,260
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

532
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,600
I'm sorry, but you
will have to leave.

533
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:25,150
We're going to move
him to another room.

534
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,230
Can you disconnect the tubes?

535
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,860
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

536
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:36,240
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

537
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,120
Help me, please.

538
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,990
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the Baker.

539
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,080
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

540
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,290
You'd better go, there's
going to be trouble.

541
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:10,000
If there is trouble, I'll stay
here to help you. For your father.

542
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,130
Listen. Wait for me outside, in
front of the hospital, all right?

543
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,300
I'll be out in a minute.

544
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:35,820
Just lie here, Pop. I'll
take care of you now.

545
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,820
I'm with you now.

546
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,990
I'm with you.

547
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:20,610
Get rid of these. Come here.

548
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,785
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun.

549
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:26,000
You'll be all right.

550
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,010
You did good.

551
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,770
I thought all you Guinea
hoods were locked up!

552
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:15,480
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

553
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,480
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

554
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:25,530
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

555
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,660
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

556
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:33,580
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

557
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:42,010
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

558
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,970
Stand him up straight.

559
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:11,740
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

560
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:14,250
They're licensed
to carry firearms.

561
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:18,750
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show 'cause.

562
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:20,840
Let him go.

563
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,160
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

564
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,130
After the hospital
thing, Sonny got mad.

565
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:03,380
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
this morning.

566
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,510
Jesus Christ.

567
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,680
Looks like a fortress
around here.

568
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:23,190
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

569
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:26,860
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead.

570
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,990
Mike, let me look at you.

571
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,080
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

572
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:43,790
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

573
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,630
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

574
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,550
What did he say... He wants us to
send Michael to hear the proposition.

575
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,100
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

576
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:58,270
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

577
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:02,650
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

578
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:05,860
No more! Not this
time, Consigliere.

579
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,490
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

580
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:12,610
I want Sollozzo,
or we go to war...

581
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,660
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

582
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,040
This is business, not personal!

583
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,540
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

584
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,210
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

585
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,300
No more advice on how to patch things up.
Just help me win.

586
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,520
I found out about Captain
McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.

587
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,900
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

588
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:50,030
McCluskey has agreed to
be The Turk's bodyguard.

589
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:53,860
So when Sollozzo is being
guarded, he's invulnerable.

590
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:57,530
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

591
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:03,580
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

592
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:07,500
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

593
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,630
Do me a favor. Take this
into consideration.

594
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,470
All right, we'll wait.

595
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:26,730
We can't wait. We can't wait.

596
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:32,150
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

597
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,950
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

598
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:40,330
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

599
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:45,000
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

600
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:53,050
They want to have a
meeting with me, right?

601
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,350
It will be me, McCluskey
and Sollozzo.

602
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,350
Let's set the meeting.

603
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,230
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

604
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:13,860
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

605
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,700
Some place where there are
people, so I feel safe.

606
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:23,450
They'll search me when
I meet them, right?

607
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,870
So I can't have a weapon on me.

608
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:34,210
But if Clemenza can figure out a way
to have a weapon planted there for me

609
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,390
then I'll kill them both.

610
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:58,200
Nice college boy. Didn't want to get
mixed up in the family business.

611
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,950
Now you want to shoot a police
captain because he slapped you?

612
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:08,580
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

613
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,710
You're taking this
very personal.

614
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:15,210
Tom, this is business and
he's taking it personal.

615
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,800
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

616
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:25,020
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed
up in drugs, a dishonest cop.

617
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:30,350
A cop who got mixed up in the
rackets and got what was coming.

618
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,030
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

619
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:40,320
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

620
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:47,580
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

621
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,330
It's as cold as they come.

622
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,670
Impossible to trace, so you
don't worry about prints.

623
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:00,130
I put a special tape on the
trigger and the butt. Try it.

624
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:14,400
Is the trigger too tight?

625
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:18,940
My ears!

626
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:23,660
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

627
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,740
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

628
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,790
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

629
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,420
Let your hand drop to your
side and let the gun slip out.

630
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:41,930
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

631
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,890
so walk out fast, but don't run.

632
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:48,390
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

633
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,980
They'll be scared stiff, so
don't worry about nothing.

634
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:58,280
You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,

635
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,440
and we'll catch the hell.

636
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:04,910
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

637
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:08,040
All the other families will
probably line up against us.

638
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,935
These things have to happen
every five, 10 years.

639
01:17:10,936 --> 01:17:13,710
Gets rid of the bad blood.

640
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:18,250
Been 10 years since the last one. You
have to stop them at the beginning.

641
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:24,090
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

642
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:30,020
You know, Mike, we were all proud of you.
Being a hero and all.

643
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,810
Your father too.

644
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:13,310
Nothing. Not a hint.
Absolutely nothing.

645
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:18,520
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

646
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,940
How much time do we have?

647
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:26,610
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

648
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:32,490
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

649
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:38,420
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

650
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:43,630
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

651
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:47,090
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

652
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:51,220
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

653
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,640
Sollozzo might not even
be in the car, Sonny!

654
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,230
I'll get it.

655
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,670
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

656
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:27,090
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

657
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:32,930
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day.
He'll be there between 8 and 10.

658
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:37,890
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

659
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:42,940
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

660
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:48,860
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

661
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:53,950
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

662
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:58,160
All right. Mike, you
go to the restaurant,

663
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:02,130
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

664
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:07,550
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

665
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:12,090
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

666
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,350
I want somebody very
good to plant that gun.

667
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,940
I don't want him coming
out with just his dick.

668
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:25,570
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

669
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:27,320
Let's move.

670
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,990
Did he tell you to drop
the gun right away?

671
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,950
Yeah, a million times.

672
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:46,920
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

673
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:57,100
How long do you think it will
be before I can come back?

674
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:00,020
At least a year.

675
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:04,940
I'll square it with Mom, that you're
not seeing her before you leave and...

676
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,320
I'll get a message to that
girlfriend when the time is right.

677
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,660
Take care.

678
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,210
Take care, Mike.

679
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:58,830
I'm glad you came. I hope we
can straighten everything out.

680
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:05,120
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

681
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:09,540
I want to straighten everything out. I
don't want my father bothered again.

682
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,880
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

683
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,180
But you have to keep an
open mind when we talk.

684
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:21,680
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

685
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,230
He's a good kid.

686
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:32,690
I'm sorry about the
other night, Mike.

687
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:36,860
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

688
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:46,670
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

689
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,920
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

690
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:55,630
He's clean.

691
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,540
Going to Jersey?

692
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,580
Maybe.

693
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,650
Nice work, Lou.

694
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:38,360
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

695
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,110
I'll have it.

696
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:18,860
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

696.1
01:25:24,756 --> 01:25:27,256
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.

696.2
01:25:30,257 --> 01:25:36,257
What happened to
your father was business.

696.3
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:41,258
I have much respect for your father...

696.4
01:25:41,259 --> 01:25:45,259
but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.

696.5
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:50,260
You must understand why
I did what I did.

696.6
01:25:51,261 --> 01:25:54,261
I understand these things.

696.7
01:25:54,762 --> 01:25:56,462
I do.

696.8
01:25:56,463 --> 01:25:58,963
You do.

696.9
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:13,464
Now we have to think about what happens

696.10
01:26:13,765 --> 01:26:17,665
between you and the Tattaglias.

696.11
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:22,465
We have to work through

696.12
01:26:22,466 --> 01:26:26,466
where we go from here.

696.13
01:26:33,966 --> 01:26:36,466
How do I say...?

697
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,150
What I want...

698
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:43,280
What's most important to me

699
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:50,240
is that I have a guarantee. No
more attempts on my father's life.

700
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:55,080
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

701
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:58,710
I missed my chance. You
think too much of me, kid.

702
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,630
I'm not that clever.

703
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,380
All I want is a truce.

704
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:14,770
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

705
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,650
When you got to go,
you got to go.

706
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:26,070
I frisked him.
He's clean.

707
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,240
Don't take too long.

708
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:33,160
I've frisked a thousand punks.

708.1
01:28:49,054 --> 01:28:51,554
Everything all right?

708.2
01:28:52,555 --> 01:28:55,055
I respect myself...  understand?

708.3
01:28:55,056 --> 01:28:58,056
And so I cannot allow your
father to hold me back.

708.4
01:28:58,857 --> 01:29:01,857
What happened was unavoidable.

708.5
01:29:02,858 --> 01:29:05,358
I had the unspoken support of
the other Dons.

708.6
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:07,859
If your father were in better health...

708.7
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:10,360
without his eldest son running things...

708.8
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:25,689
Hey, come on.

708.9
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:28,190
Come on. Let's go.

709
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,790
Joe, you take over.

710
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:44,890
I love you, Grandpa.

710.1
01:32:29,187 --> 01:32:31,687
Hi, Grandpa.

711
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,520
I'm sorry, Pa. He
doesn't know you yet.

712
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:54,940
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

713
01:32:55,060 --> 01:33:01,320
" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

714
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,620
Go with your mother.

715
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,830
Take them downstairs.

716
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,000
Go on, Carlo, you too.

717
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:20,420
Go on.

718
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:45,030
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

719
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:06,640
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

720
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:13,270
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

721
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:16,850
They hit us, so
we hit them back.

722
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:22,230
Through our newspaper contacts we've
been able to put out material

723
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:26,610
about McCluskey's link with
Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

724
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,820
So things are loosening up.

725
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:34,830
And I'm sending
Fredo to Las Vegas,

726
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:37,460
under the protection of
Don Francesco of L.A.

727
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:42,090
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

728
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:52,220
Where's Michael?

729
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:07,660
It was Michael who
killed Sollozzo.

730
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:13,290
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back.

731
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,060
I want you to find out where that
old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

732
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:39,100
I want him now.

733
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:42,730
Sonny, things are
starting to loosen up.

734
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:47,530
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

735
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:53,620
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

736
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,540
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

737
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:02,590
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

738
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:08,760
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

739
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,140
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

740
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,020
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

741
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:21,150
Ma made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

742
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:26,440
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

743
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:30,700
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

744
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:34,120
That's because they've
started making big money.

745
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,500
Papa never talked
business at the table.

746
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:41,460
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

747
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:43,290
Don't interfere.

748
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:49,510
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

749
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:52,380
We don't discuss
business at the table.

750
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,230
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

751
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,780
Why are you so far
from the house?

752
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:53,110
You know I'm responsible to
your father for your life.

753
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,490
The bodyguards are here.

754
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,740
It's still dangerous...

755
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,620
We've heard from
Santino in New York...

756
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,290
Your enemies know you're here.

757
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,040
Did Santino say
when I can go back?

758
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,000
Not yet.

759
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:11,510
It's out of the question.

760
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:16,390
Where are you going now?

761
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,100
To Corleone.

762
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,970
Take my car.

763
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:25,350
I want to walk.

764
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,150
Be careful.

765
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,060
Where have all the men gone?

766
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,310
They're all dead from vendettas.

767
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,360
There are the names of the dead.

768
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:32,880
Hey, hey, take me to
the America, G.I.!

769
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,260
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable!

770
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:42,640
America! Take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

771
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:02,620
Mamma Mia what a beauty.

772
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,880
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

773
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:24,100
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

774
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,950
Did you have a good hunt?

775
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:52,290
You know all the
girls around here?

776
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:54,290
We saw some real beauties.

777
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:58,630
One of them struck our
friend like a thunderbolt.

778
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,600
She would tempt the
devil himself.

779
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:14,400
Really put together.

780
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,520
Right, Calo?

781
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,280
Such hair, such mouth!

782
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,830
The girls around here are beautiful...
but virtuous.

783
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,750
This one had a purple dress...

784
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,250
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

785
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,290
A type more Greek than Italian.

786
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,550
Do you know her?

787
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:47,760
There's no girl like
that in this town.

788
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,680
My God, I understand!

789
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:56,810
What's wrong?

790
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,400
Let's go.

791
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,610
It's his daughter.

792
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:05,570
Tell him to come here.

793
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:10,330
Call him.

794
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,720
Fabrizio, you translate.

795
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,730
I apologize if I offended you.

796
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:43,150
I'm a stranger in this country.

797
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:46,320
I meant no disrespect to
you or your daughter.

798
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:54,660
I'm an American,
hiding in Sicily.

799
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,420
My name is Michael Corleone.

800
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,590
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

801
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,800
But then your daughter
would lose a father

802
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,770
instead of gaining a husband.

803
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:24,150
I want to meet your daughter.

804
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:29,410
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

805
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:31,740
With all respect.

806
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:41,790
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

807
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,800
What's her name?

807.1
01:43:50,204 --> 01:43:52,704
Apollonia.

807.2
01:44:47,205 --> 01:44:50,205
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

807.3
01:44:50,206 --> 01:44:53,206
and this is Michael Corleone.

807.4
01:45:09,207 --> 01:45:11,207
Thank you.

807.5
01:45:11,808 --> 01:45:13,808
Your welcome.

807.6
01:45:23,809 --> 01:45:26,309
What's the problem with your eye.

807.7
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:29,310
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

808
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:46,310
I'll knock you dizzy.

809
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:54,150
Save it for the library.

810
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:00,490
We've got to pick up my sister.

811
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:20,260
What's the matter?

812
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,520
What's the matter?

813
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:28,230
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

814
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:31,480
It was my fault. I hit him.

815
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:35,360
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

816
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:43,870
I'm just going to get a
doctor to take a look at you.

817
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:46,460
Sonny, please don't do anything.

818
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,500
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

819
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:53,460
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

820
01:47:58,010 --> 01:48:01,220
You spic slobs still
betting Yankees?

821
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,970
Tell them to stop
taking in action.

822
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:06,520
We lost enough money last week.

823
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:15,690
Come here, come here!

824
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:15,960
If you touch my sister
again, I'll kill you.

825
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:13,450
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

826
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:17,870
Yes, I have. I've tried
writing and calling.

827
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:21,790
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

828
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:24,420
All we know is that
he's all right.

829
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,590
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

830
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:35,850
Tom, will you give this
letter to Michael. Please?

831
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:42,560
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

832
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,440
He'll get in touch with you.

833
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:49,230
I let my cab go, so can I
call another one, please?

834
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:51,190
Come on. Sorry.

835
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:13,090
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

836
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,340
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

837
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:19,810
Tell him that I can't make
it tonight until later.

838
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,810
Bitch!

839
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,610
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

840
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:35,030
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

841
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:38,490
- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!

842
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:40,830
I'll vafangool you!

843
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:48,460
She has a filthy mouth,
this Guinea brat.

844
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:57,140
That's it, break it all, you
spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

845
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:09,480
Why don't you bring your
whore home for dinner?

846
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,150
Maybe I will.

847
01:55:18,910 --> 01:55:22,080
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

848
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:26,080
You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up!
Clean it up!

849
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:30,670
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

850
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:35,590
Clean it up. Clean
that up, you...

851
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:40,550
Clean it!

852
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:44,890
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be
a murderer, like your father!

853
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:48,440
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

854
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,230
Come on, kill me!

855
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:53,440
Get out of here!

856
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:56,950
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

857
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:59,700
You Guinea brat.
Get out of here!

858
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:13,130
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

859
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:17,300
Connie, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

860
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:20,300
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

861
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:23,390
Yeah, Connie.

862
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:30,020
You wait there.

863
01:56:32,650 --> 01:56:35,190
No, you just wait there.

864
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,610
Son-of-a-bitch.

865
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:42,910
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

866
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:50,160
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

867
01:56:58,170 --> 01:56:59,420
Sonny!

868
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:07,890
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

869
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:10,850
Go after him, go on!

870
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:42,630
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

871
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:33,160
Give me a drop.

872
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,880
My wife is crying upstairs.

873
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:48,760
I hear cars coming to the house.

874
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:56,350
Consigliere of mine,

875
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:59,940
tell your Don what
everyone seems to know.

876
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:02,400
I didn't tell Mama anything.

877
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,610
I was about to come up and
wake you and tell you.

878
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:12,330
But you needed a drink first.

879
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:15,910
Yeah.

880
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:21,710
Well, now you've had your drink.

881
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:31,140
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

882
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:50,740
I want no inquiries made.

883
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,750
I want no acts of vengeance.

884
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:02,290
I want you to arrange a meeting

885
02:01:03,290 --> 02:01:05,920
with the heads of
the five families.

886
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,920
This war stops now.

887
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:34,410
Call Bonasera.

888
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:36,660
I need him now.

889
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:54,220
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

890
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,680
You owe your Don a service.

891
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:00,310
He has no doubt that
you will repay it.

892
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:02,560
He will be at your funeral
parlor in one hour.

893
02:02:02,561 --> 02:02:04,730
Be there to greet him.

894
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:30,710
Well, my friend, are you
ready to do me this service?

895
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,880
Yes. What do you want me to do?

896
02:02:42,270 --> 02:02:46,730
I want you to use all your
powers and all your skills.

897
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:53,820
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

898
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,960
Look how they massacred my boy.

899
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:45,250
It's safer to teach you English!

900
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,420
I know English...

901
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:52,290
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

902
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:01,300
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

903
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:04,010
How are things in Palermo?

904
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:14,070
Michael is teaching me to drive...
watch, I'll show you.

905
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:18,700
How are things in Palermo?

906
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:22,200
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

907
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:26,660
times are changing
for the worse.

908
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:32,330
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

909
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:40,220
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

910
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:47,390
What's wrong?

911
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,730
Bad news from America.

912
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:56,900
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

913
02:05:03,490 --> 02:05:05,330
Let's go... you promised.

914
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:25,140
Fabrizio!

915
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:26,640
Get the car.
- Yes, sir?

916
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:32,190
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

917
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:35,860
No, take her to her father's
house until things are safe.

918
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:37,860
Okay, anything you say.

919
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,530
Calo, where is Apollonia?

920
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:49,790
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

921
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:54,120
She'll make a good
American wife.

922
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,130
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

923
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:10,560
Fabrizio!

924
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,310
Where are you going?

925
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,440
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

926
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:23,990
No, Apollonia!

927
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:52,890
Don Barzini, I want to thank you for
helping me organize this meeting,

928
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:57,860
and the other heads of the five
families from New York and New Jersey.

929
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:02,740
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

930
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:06,160
and from Brooklyn

931
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:09,870
Philip Tattaglia.

932
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:14,370
And from Staten Island

933
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,960
we have with us Victor Strachi.

934
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:23,670
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

935
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,510
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

936
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:37,810
How did things ever get so far?

937
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,520
I don't know.

938
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:45,070
It was so unfortunate,
so unnecessary.

939
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:51,620
Tattaglia lost a son,
and I lost a son.

940
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:57,500
We're quits. And if
Tattaglia agrees,

941
02:07:57,580 --> 02:08:01,590
then I'm willing to let
things go on as before.

942
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:06,670
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

943
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:12,140
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

944
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:16,310
Yes, Don Barzini.
He's too modest.

945
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:20,600
He had all the judges and
politicians in his pocket.

946
02:08:20,690 --> 02:08:23,570
He refused to share them.

947
02:08:23,650 --> 02:08:27,440
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

948
02:08:27,530 --> 02:08:29,910
All of you know me.

949
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:35,990
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

950
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:43,500
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

951
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:47,840
It's not like gambling
or liquor or even women,

952
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:53,890
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

953
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:58,730
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

954
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:03,020
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

955
02:09:03,110 --> 02:09:08,240
I believed that then and
I believe that now.

956
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,530
Times have changed.

957
02:09:10,650 --> 02:09:15,370
It's not like the old days, when
we could do anything we wanted.

958
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:18,330
A refusal is not the
act of a friend.

959
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:23,830
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

960
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:28,510
or let others use them. He must let
us draw the water from the well.

961
02:09:29,590 --> 02:09:33,180
Certainly he can present a
bill for such services.

962
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:35,850
After all, we're not communists.

963
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:42,060
I also don't believe in drugs.

964
02:09:42,190 --> 02:09:47,020
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

965
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:50,240
Somebody says to them
" I have powders."

966
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:53,570
" If you put up 3-4,000
dollar investment,

967
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:56,660
we can make 50,000
distributing."

968
02:09:57,870 --> 02:10:03,790
They can't resist. I want to control
it as a business, keep it respectable.

969
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:08,670
I don't want it near schools, I
don't want it sold to children.

970
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:10,550
Thats an infàmia.

971
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:15,800
In my city we would keep the
traffic to the colored.

972
02:10:15,890 --> 02:10:19,100
They're animals, so let
them lose their souls.

973
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:29,320
I hoped that we could come
here and reason together.

974
02:10:30,730 --> 02:10:37,370
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

975
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:42,500
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

976
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:46,880
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

977
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:50,710
I must have strict
assurance from Corleone.

978
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:54,090
As time goes by and his
position becomes stronger,

979
02:10:54,170 --> 02:10:56,840
will he attempt any
individual vendetta?

980
02:10:56,930 --> 02:11:02,060
We are all reasonable men. We
don't have to give assurances.

981
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:05,020
You talk about vengeance.

982
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:08,360
Will vengeance bring
your son back to you?

983
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,980
Or my boy to me?

984
02:11:11,070 --> 02:11:13,860
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

985
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:18,950
But I have selfish reasons.

986
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:24,830
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

987
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:29,250
because of this
Sollozzo business.

988
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:34,720
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

989
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,470
Cleared of all these
false charges.

990
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:42,010
But I'm a superstitious man.

991
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:47,440
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

992
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:52,400
or if he should hang
himself in his jail cell,

993
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:55,360
or if he's struck by
a bolt of lightning,

994
02:11:56,650 --> 02:12:00,240
then I'm going to blame some
of the people in this room.

995
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:04,240
And that I do not forgive.

996
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:09,080
But, that aside

997
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:14,500
let me say that I swear

998
02:12:16,130 --> 02:12:19,260
on the souls of
my grandchildren,

999
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:23,720
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1000
02:12:49,210 --> 02:12:54,670
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1001
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,880
Mention it. Don't insist.

1002
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,800
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1003
02:13:05,430 --> 02:13:07,390
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1004
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:11,600
He could never have
outfought Santino.

1005
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:19,570
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1006
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,130
Come on, Nancy.

1007
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:40,920
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1008
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:43,930
Okay, all right.

1009
02:13:57,020 --> 02:13:59,230
How long have you been back?

1010
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:01,860
I've been back a year.

1011
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,410
Longer than that, I think.

1012
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:10,410
It's good to see you, Kay.

1013
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:24,010
I'm working for my
father now, Kay.

1014
02:14:26,510 --> 02:14:29,510
He's been sick. Very sick.

1015
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:33,020
But you're not like him.

1016
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:36,900
You told me you weren't going
to become like your father.

1017
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:43,110
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1018
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,660
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1019
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:50,290
Like a senator or president.

1020
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:52,830
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1021
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:55,750
They don't have men killed.

1022
02:14:59,170 --> 02:15:01,170
Who's being naive, Kay?

1023
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:06,680
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1024
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:12,600
In five years the Corleone family is
going to be completely legitimate.

1025
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:18,400
Trust me. That's all I can tell
you about my business. Kay...

1026
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:22,980
Michael, why did you come here?
Why?

1027
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:26,700
What do you want with
me after all this time?

1028
02:15:26,701 --> 02:15:29,120
I've been calling and writing.

1029
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:32,700
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1030
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:36,620
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1031
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:40,920
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1032
02:15:42,670 --> 02:15:46,550
I'll do anything you ask to make
up for what's happened to us.

1033
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:52,470
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1034
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:57,270
we have each other. That
we have a life together.

1035
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:01,570
That we have children.
Our children.

1036
02:16:03,070 --> 02:16:05,240
Kay, I need you.

1037
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:08,780
And I love you.

1038
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:34,680
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1039
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:38,440
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1040
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:41,650
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1041
02:16:41,730 --> 02:16:44,860
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1042
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:48,400
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1043
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:52,370
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1044
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:56,040
Don Corleone...

1045
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:00,250
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1046
02:17:00,330 --> 02:17:04,380
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1047
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:08,050
Michael is now head
of the family.

1048
02:17:08,130 --> 02:17:12,430
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1049
02:17:12,510 --> 02:17:14,890
After we make the move to Nevada

1050
02:17:14,970 --> 02:17:19,390
you can leave the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1051
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:23,810
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1052
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:27,150
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1053
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:30,070
me and Pete will come
under Barzini's thumb.

1054
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:35,830
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1055
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:38,830
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1056
02:17:38,910 --> 02:17:41,830
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1057
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,170
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1058
02:17:50,090 --> 02:17:55,430
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1059
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:57,850
That's all I can tell you now.

1060
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:01,270
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1061
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:04,730
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1062
02:18:04,810 --> 02:18:09,610
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1063
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:12,240
That's no reflection on
Tom, just how I want it.

1064
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:17,030
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1065
02:18:37,050 --> 02:18:40,890
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1066
02:18:40,970 --> 02:18:43,890
Mike... Why am I out?

1067
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,110
You're not a wartime
consigliere, Tom.

1068
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:52,650
Things may get rough
with the move.

1069
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:54,030
Tom.

1070
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:04,370
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1071
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:08,590
I thought Santino was a
bad Don, rest in peace.

1072
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:13,260
Michael has all my
confidence, just as you do.

1073
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:19,220
But there are reasons why you must have
no part in what is going to happen.

1074
02:19:20,260 --> 02:19:23,310
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1075
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:16,780
I can't get over the way
your face looks. So good!

1076
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:21,490
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1077
02:20:21,570 --> 02:20:25,700
Leave them out here. He's
tired and wants to clean up.

1078
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:28,160
Let me open the door, all right?

1079
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:39,760
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1080
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,470
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1081
02:20:46,390 --> 02:20:49,480
I'll be right back.
Keep them occupied.

1082
02:20:50,690 --> 02:20:54,190
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1083
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:59,030
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1084
02:21:00,570 --> 02:21:05,240
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1085
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:08,000
I'm tired. Get rid
of the band too.

1086
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:17,170
Hey, take off. Take off.
Let's go.

1087
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:19,380
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1088
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:23,220
Hey, come on! Scram!

1089
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:28,430
Come on, honey. I don't know what's
the matter with him, Johnny.

1090
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:29,810
Sorry.

1091
02:21:31,770 --> 02:21:34,310
I don't know. He's tired.

1092
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:44,410
What happened to Moe Greene?

1093
02:21:44,490 --> 02:21:48,830
He had some business. He said to give
him a call when the party started.

1094
02:21:48,910 --> 02:21:50,870
Well, give him a call.

1095
02:21:52,250 --> 02:21:55,380
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1096
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:57,670
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1097
02:21:57,750 --> 02:22:01,340
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1098
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:03,680
Well, I owe it all to him.

1099
02:22:04,890 --> 02:22:06,470
He knows how grateful you are.

1100
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:09,810
That's why he'd like
to ask a favor of you.

1101
02:22:09,890 --> 02:22:11,810
Mike, what can I do?

1102
02:22:12,980 --> 02:22:15,440
We're thinking of
giving up our interests

1103
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:18,440
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1104
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:24,610
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1105
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:27,450
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1106
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:30,540
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothing about selling.

1107
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:33,330
I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1108
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:37,040
See, Johnny...

1109
02:22:37,130 --> 02:22:41,340
We figure that entertainment would
draw gamblers to the casino.

1110
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:45,180
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1111
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:52,730
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1112
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:56,100
We're counting on you.

1113
02:22:58,110 --> 02:23:01,780
Sure, Mike. I'll do
anything for my godfather.

1114
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,150
Good.

1115
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:09,410
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1116
02:23:09,490 --> 02:23:12,040
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1117
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:17,250
Have everything? Specially prepared food,
the best dancers, and good credit.

1118
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:20,920
Draw chips for everybody, so
they can play on the house.

1119
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:26,340
Is my credit good
enough to buy you out?

1120
02:23:28,090 --> 02:23:29,930
Buy me out?

1121
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:32,600
The casino, the hotel.

1122
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:35,600
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1123
02:23:35,690 --> 02:23:41,110
The Corleone family wants to buy me out?
No, I buy you out.

1124
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:44,610
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1125
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:48,570
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1126
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:55,790
You Guineas make me laugh.

1127
02:23:55,910 --> 02:24:00,500
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1128
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:05,300
You did that because we
bankrolled your casino

1129
02:24:05,380 --> 02:24:08,010
and the Molinari family
guaranteed his safety.

1130
02:24:08,011 --> 02:24:10,640
Let's talk business.

1131
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:13,470
Yes. First of all,
you're all done.

1132
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:16,020
You don't have that
kind of muscle anymore.

1133
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:20,520
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1134
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:24,530
Do you think you can come
to my hotel and take over?

1135
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:29,660
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1136
02:24:29,740 --> 02:24:33,240
Is that why you slapped my
brother around in public?

1137
02:24:33,330 --> 02:24:38,160
That was nothing, Mike. Moe
didn't mean nothing by that.

1138
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:42,460
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1139
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:47,300
I have a business to run. I've
got to kick asses sometimes.

1140
02:24:47,380 --> 02:24:51,260
We had an argument, so I
had to straighten him out.

1141
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:54,180
You straightened my brother out?

1142
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:58,730
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1143
02:24:58,810 --> 02:25:00,770
What's wrong with you?

1144
02:25:05,650 --> 02:25:08,780
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1145
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:11,320
Son-of-a-bitch!

1146
02:25:11,410 --> 02:25:16,580
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when
you were out with cheerleaders.

1147
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:19,160
Wait a minute, Moe.
I have an idea.

1148
02:25:20,290 --> 02:25:23,840
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1149
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:29,340
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1150
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:32,760
If you have anything to
say, say it to Michael.

1151
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:42,480
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1152
02:25:43,230 --> 02:25:44,440
Fredo...

1153
02:25:45,650 --> 02:25:48,400
You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1154
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:53,870
But don't ever take sides with
anyone against the family again.

1155
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:56,370
Ever.

1156
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:08,670
I have to see my father and his
people, so have dinner without me.

1157
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:15,300
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1158
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:25,730
Your sister wants to
ask you something.

1159
02:26:25,810 --> 02:26:27,940
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1160
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:30,990
They want you to be
godfather to their boy.

1161
02:26:31,070 --> 02:26:32,900
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1162
02:26:32,990 --> 02:26:35,320
Let me think about it. Come on.

1163
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:47,080
Barzini will move
against you first.

1164
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:51,590
He'll set up a meeting with
someone you absolutely trust.

1165
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:53,720
Guaranteeing your safety.

1166
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:58,050
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1167
02:27:02,770 --> 02:27:05,770
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1168
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:10,690
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1169
02:27:15,740 --> 02:27:17,240
I don't know.

1170
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:22,200
Are you happy with your
wife and children?

1171
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:26,000
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1172
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:32,760
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1173
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:35,800
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1174
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:40,260
I spend my life trying
not to be careless.

1175
02:27:41,810 --> 02:27:45,270
Women and children can be
careless, but not men.

1176
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:50,940
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1177
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:53,780
He looks more like
you every day.

1178
02:27:56,490 --> 02:28:00,950
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1179
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:05,120
Read the funny papers.

1180
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:17,970
I want you to arrange for a telephone man
to check all in-and out-going calls.

1181
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:20,740
I did it already. I
took care of that, Pop.

1182
02:28:20,741 --> 02:28:23,390
That's right. I forgot.

1183
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:29,150
What's the matter?

1184
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:32,020
What's bothering you?

1185
02:28:35,610 --> 02:28:40,240
I'll handle it. I told you I can
handle it, so I'll handle it.

1186
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:58,010
I knew that Santino would
have to go through all this.

1187
02:28:58,090 --> 02:28:59,720
And Fredo...

1188
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:04,470
Fredo was, well...

1189
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:09,190
But I never wanted this for you.

1190
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:16,570
I worked my whole life. I don't
apologize for taking care of my family.

1191
02:29:16,650 --> 02:29:20,570
And I refused to be a fool,

1192
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:24,780
dancing on a string held
by all those big shots.

1193
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:30,210
I don't apologize. That's my
life, but I thought that,

1194
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:37,050
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1195
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:44,510
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1196
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:47,600
Another pezzonovante.

1197
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,350
Well...

1198
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:56,480
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1199
02:29:56,570 --> 02:30:00,070
We'll get there, Pop.
We'll get there.

1200
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:09,370
Now listen, whoever comes to
you with this Barzini meeting,

1201
02:30:09,450 --> 02:30:12,420
he's the traitor.
Don't forget that.

1202
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:31,520
Can I hold it, please?

1203
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:50,490
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1204
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:53,370
Over here, over here.

1205
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:57,750
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1206
02:31:04,130 --> 02:31:05,890
Anthony!

1207
02:31:05,970 --> 02:31:07,640
Come here, come here.

1208
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:15,480
That's it. We'll put
it right there.

1209
02:31:20,690 --> 02:31:23,280
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1210
02:31:25,320 --> 02:31:27,200
Stand there.

1211
02:31:30,950 --> 02:31:32,700
Give me an orange!

1212
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:52,850
That's a new trick.

1213
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:56,190
You run in there. Run in there.

1214
02:32:09,740 --> 02:32:11,700
Where are you?

1215
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:11,760
Mike, can I have a minute?

1216
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:24,310
Barzini wants to
arrange a meeting.

1217
02:35:24,390 --> 02:35:27,690
He says we can straighten
out any of our problems.

1218
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:30,570
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1219
02:35:31,900 --> 02:35:35,700
I can arrange security.
On my territory.

1220
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:41,290
- All right?
- All right.

1221
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:01,760
Do you know how they're
going to come at you?

1222
02:36:04,270 --> 02:36:07,940
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.
Tessio's ground.

1223
02:36:10,110 --> 02:36:11,900
Where I'll be safe.

1224
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:27,750
I always thought it would
be Clemenza, not Tessio.

1225
02:36:27,830 --> 02:36:31,630
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1226
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:35,170
But I'm going to wait.

1227
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:36,840
After the baptism.

1228
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:44,310
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1229
02:36:44,390 --> 02:36:48,560
And then I'll meet with Don
Barzini and Tattaglia.

1230
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:53,110
All the heads of
the five families.

1230.1
02:37:19,215 --> 02:37:21,215
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1230.2
02:37:21,416 --> 02:37:24,616
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1230.3
02:37:26,617 --> 02:37:27,617
Let us pray.

1230.4
02:37:27,618 --> 02:37:30,618
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1230.5
02:37:31,219 --> 02:37:32,219
Michael.

1230.6
02:37:32,220 --> 02:37:35,220
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1230.7
02:37:36,221 --> 02:37:39,221
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1230.8
02:37:39,222 --> 02:37:42,222
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1230.9
02:37:42,223 --> 02:37:45,223
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1230.10
02:37:45,224 --> 02:37:48,224
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1230.11
02:37:48,225 --> 02:37:51,225
<i>Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

1230.12
02:37:51,226 --> 02:37:53,726
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1230.13
02:37:53,727 --> 02:37:56,727
<i>look graciously down upon this,
thy servant, Michael.</i>

1230.14
02:37:56,728 --> 02:37:59,728
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1230.15
02:37:59,729 --> 02:38:02,729
and the world by fire. So be it.

1230.16
02:38:02,730 --> 02:38:05,030
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1230.17
02:38:05,031 --> 02:38:07,331
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1230.18
02:38:07,332 --> 02:38:09,332
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1230.19
02:38:09,333 --> 02:38:11,833
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1230.20
02:38:11,834 --> 02:38:14,334
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

1230.21
02:38:15,335 --> 02:38:17,835
<i>and who hath given thee the
remission of all thy sins,</i>

1230.22
02:38:18,336 --> 02:38:21,836
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with
the Chrism of Salvation,</i>

1230.23
02:38:21,837 --> 02:38:24,837
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,
unto life eternal. So be it.</i>

1230.24
02:38:25,838 --> 02:38:29,138
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1230.25
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:32,439
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1230.26
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:42,840
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1230.27
02:38:42,841 --> 02:38:45,841
<i>the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1230.28
02:38:45,842 --> 02:38:49,342
<i>the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting? I do believe.</i>

1230.29
02:38:50,343 --> 02:38:53,343
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1230.30
02:38:53,344 --> 02:38:56,344
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1230.31
02:38:56,345 --> 02:39:00,345
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1230.32
02:39:00,346 --> 02:39:03,846
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1230.33
02:39:05,647 --> 02:39:08,647
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1230.34
02:39:08,648 --> 02:39:11,648
Be thou, devil, begone,

1230.35
02:39:11,649 --> 02:39:13,949
for the judgment of God shall draw near.

1231
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:19,040
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1232
02:39:19,130 --> 02:39:20,300
I do.

1233
02:39:20,380 --> 02:39:23,880
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1234
02:39:23,970 --> 02:39:24,970
I do.

1235
02:39:25,050 --> 02:39:29,100
Do you believe in the Holy
Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?

1236
02:39:29,180 --> 02:39:30,470
I do.

1236.1
02:39:30,441 --> 02:39:34,341
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1236.2
02:39:34,342 --> 02:39:38,342
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1236.3
02:39:38,343 --> 02:39:41,143
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1236.3
02:39:41,144 --> 02:39:43,144
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1236.4
02:39:43,345 --> 02:39:46,438
<i>as we forgive them that
trespass against us.</i>

1236.5
02:39:46,439 --> 02:39:49,439
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1236.6
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:51,440
<i>but deliver us from evil.
So be it.</i>

1236.7
02:39:51,441 --> 02:39:52,941
Michael.

1236.8
02:39:52,942 --> 02:39:55,942
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1236.9
02:39:55,943 --> 02:39:58,943
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1236.10
02:39:58,944 --> 02:40:01,444
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1236.11
02:40:01,445 --> 02:40:03,445
Creator of heaven and earth,

1236.12
02:40:03,446 --> 02:40:06,946
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only
son our Lord,</i>

1236.13
02:40:06,947 --> 02:40:09,247
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1236.14
02:40:09,248 --> 02:40:11,248
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1236.15
02:40:11,249 --> 02:40:14,549
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried.</i>

1236.16
02:40:14,551 --> 02:40:17,251
<i>He descended into Hell.
On the third day,</i>

1236.17
02:40:17,252 --> 02:40:21,252
<i>He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven,</i>

1236.18
02:40:21,253 --> 02:40:24,053
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of
God the Father almighty,</i>

1236.19
02:40:24,054 --> 02:40:26,554
<i>from thence shall he come to judge
the living and the dead.</i>

1236.20
02:40:26,555 --> 02:40:29,555
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1236.21
02:40:29,556 --> 02:40:32,556
<i>the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1236.22
02:40:32,557 --> 02:40:35,357
<i>the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. So be it.</i>

1237
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:40,380
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1238
02:40:46,630 --> 02:40:47,880
I do renounce him.

1239
02:40:57,560 --> 02:40:58,980
And all his works?

1240
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:13,910
I do renounce them.

1241
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,910
Oh, God!

1242
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:23,500
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1243
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:43,480
Michael Rizzi, will
you be baptized?

1244
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:44,770
I will.

1244.1
02:41:45,208 --> 02:41:47,508
In the name of the Father,

1244.2
02:41:47,509 --> 02:41:49,509
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1244.3
02:41:49,510 --> 02:41:51,910
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1245
02:41:51,910 --> 02:41:57,410
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and
may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1246
02:42:11,630 --> 02:42:13,550
Kay!

1247
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:15,600
Kiss your godfather.

1248
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,080
- Carlo.
- What?
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1249
02:42:44,170 --> 02:42:45,830
Everybody has to
leave without us.

1250
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:48,880
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1251
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,510
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1252
02:42:53,630 --> 02:42:56,010
I'll only be a couple of days.

1253
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:14,490
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1254
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:20,410
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1255
02:43:28,210 --> 02:43:33,630
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1256
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:37,260
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1257
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:39,510
I can't go either, Sal.

1258
02:43:51,480 --> 02:43:55,400
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1259
02:43:57,070 --> 02:43:59,910
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1260
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:08,380
Tom, can you get
me off the hook?

1261
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:12,710
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1262
02:44:58,130 --> 02:45:00,970
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1263
02:45:05,850 --> 02:45:09,770
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1264
02:45:10,810 --> 02:45:14,730
That little farce you
played with my sister.

1265
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:19,910
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1266
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:22,700
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1267
02:45:25,370 --> 02:45:27,660
Don't do this to me, please.

1268
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:38,670
Barzini is dead.

1269
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:43,140
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1270
02:45:44,350 --> 02:45:45,850
Moe Greene.

1271
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:50,600
Strachi. Cuneo.

1272
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:57,820
Today I settle all family business, so
don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1273
02:45:57,900 --> 02:45:59,690
Admit what you did.

1274
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:05,280
Get him a drink.

1275
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:12,870
Come on.

1276
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:16,630
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1277
02:46:16,710 --> 02:46:19,590
Do you think I'd make
my sister a widow?

1278
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:23,430
I'm godfather to
your son, Carlo.

1279
02:46:30,350 --> 02:46:32,390
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1280
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:41,030
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1281
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:46,070
You're finished. I'm putting
you on a plane to Vegas.

1282
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:47,780
Tom.

1283
02:46:51,910 --> 02:46:55,500
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1284
02:46:55,580 --> 02:46:58,170
Only don't tell me
you're innocent.

1285
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:03,680
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1286
02:47:07,930 --> 02:47:09,970
Who approached you?

1287
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:13,480
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1288
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:23,070
It was Barzini.

1289
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:28,780
Good.

1290
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:39,040
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1291
02:47:39,130 --> 02:47:42,670
I'll call your wife and tell
her what flight you're on.

1292
02:47:46,970 --> 02:47:49,510
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1293
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:17,290
Hello, Carlo.

1294
02:49:17,140 --> 02:49:20,270
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1295
02:49:28,650 --> 02:49:30,740
Michael!

1296
02:49:30,820 --> 02:49:32,820
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1297
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:40,370
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1298
02:49:40,460 --> 02:49:44,540
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1299
02:49:44,630 --> 02:49:47,710
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1300
02:49:47,800 --> 02:49:53,600
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1301
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:55,310
Connie.

1302
02:49:57,560 --> 02:50:00,270
Why do you think he
kept Carlo at the Mall?

1303
02:50:00,350 --> 02:50:03,190
He knew he was
going to kill him.

1304
02:50:03,270 --> 02:50:08,610
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1305
02:50:08,690 --> 02:50:12,780
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1306
02:50:12,860 --> 02:50:15,620
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1307
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:29,510
No! No, no...

1308
02:50:29,590 --> 02:50:32,970
Take her upstairs.
Get her a doctor.

1309
02:50:54,110 --> 02:50:55,820
She's hysterical.

1310
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:02,120
Hysterical.

1311
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:05,830
Michael, is it true?

1312
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:11,510
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1313
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:14,340
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1314
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:35,910
All right.

1315
02:51:38,740 --> 02:51:40,490
This one time.

1316
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:47,790
This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1317
02:51:53,880 --> 02:51:55,300
Is it true?

1318
02:51:59,390 --> 02:52:00,890
Is it?

1319
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:04,020
No.

1320
02:52:17,950 --> 02:52:20,910
I guess we both need a drink.
Come on.

1321
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:53,900
Don Corleone.
